# Nested Cross-Validation: Comparing Methods and Implementations  

Nested cross-validation has become a recommended technique for situations in which the size of our dataset is insufficient to simultaneously handle hyperparameter tuning and algorithm comparison. Using standard methods such as k-fold cross-validation in such situations results in  significant increases in optimization bias. Nested cross-validation has been shown to produce low bias, out-of-sample error estimates even using datasets with only a few hundred rows and therefore gives a better judgemnet of generalization performance.  

The primary issue with this technique is that it is computationally very expensive with potentially tens of 1000s of models being trained during the process. While researching this technique, I found two methods of performing nested cross-validation — one authored by [Sabastian Raschka](https://github.com/rasbt/stat479-machine-learning-fs19/blob/master/11_eval4-algo/code/11-eval4-algo__nested-cv_verbose1.ipynb) and the other by [Max Kuhn and Kjell Johnson](https://tidymodels.github.io/rsample/articles/Applications/Nested_Resampling.html).  
This experiment seeks to answer two questions:  

1. What's the fastest implementation of each method?  
2. How many repeats, given the size of this dataset, should we expect to need to obtain a reasonably accurate out-of-sample error estimate?  

With regards to the question of speed, I'll will be testing implementations of both methods from various packages which include {tune}, {mlr3}, {h2o}, and {sklearn}.  

Duration experiment details:  
   
   * Random Forest and Elastic Net Regression algorithms  
   * Both with 100x2 hyperparameter grids  
   * Kuhn-Johnson  
      + 100 observations  10 features, numeric target variable  
      + outer loop: 2 repeats, 10 folds  
      + inner loop: 25 bootstrap resamples  
   * Raschka  
      + 5000 observations: 10 features, numeric target variable  
      + outer loop: 5 folds  
      + inner loop: 2 folds  

(Size of the data sets are the same as those in the original scripts by the authors)  


Various elements of the technique can be altered to improve performance. These include:  

1. Hyperparameter value grids  
2. Outer-Loop CV strategy  
3. Inner-Loop CV strategy  
4. Grid search strategy  

For the performance experiment (question 2), the fastest implementation of each method will be used in running a nested cross-validation with different sizes of data ranging from 100 to 5000 observations and different numbers of repeats of the outer-loop cv strategy. The chosen algorithm and hyperparameters will predict on a 100K row simulated dataset and the mean absolute error will be calculated for each combination of repeat, data size, and method.
